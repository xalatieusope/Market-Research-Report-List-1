<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CAR T-Cell Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Allogeneic</li><li>Autologous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CAR T-cell therapy is an advanced treatment for certain cancers, utilizing modified T-cells to target and eliminate malignant cells. The market is segmented into autologous and allogeneic types. Autologous CAR T-cell therapy involves collecting a patient’s own T-cells, modifying them, and reinfusing them, offering personalized treatment but requiring time for cell production. Allogeneic CAR T-cell therapy uses donor T-cells, allowing for immediate treatment and potential widespread application, though it may carry risks of immune rejection and graft-versus-host disease.</p></p>
