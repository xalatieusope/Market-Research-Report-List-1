<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Cannula Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Venous Cannula</li><li>Arterial Cannula</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cardiac cannula market consists of two primary types: venous cannula and arterial cannula. Venous cannula are designed for the drainage of deoxygenated blood from the body to the heart-lung machine during surgeries, ensuring efficient blood circulation. In contrast, arterial cannula facilitate the delivery of oxygenated blood from the heart-lung machine back into the systemic circulation. Both types are crucial in cardiac procedures, aiding in the management of blood flow and support during complex surgical interventions.</p></p>
