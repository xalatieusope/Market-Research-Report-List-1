<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Door Monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normally Open Fire Door Monitor</li><li>Normal Closed Fire Door Monitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fire door monitor market includes two primary types: Normally Open Fire Door Monitors (NOM) and Normally Closed Fire Door Monitors (NCM). NOMs are designed to remain open under normal conditions, allowing free passage, while automatically closing during a fire to prevent smoke and flames from spreading. Conversely, NCMs remain closed until activated by a fire alarm, ensuring doors are sealed until needed. Both types play critical roles in enhancing safety and compliance in building design and fire protection strategies.</p></p>
