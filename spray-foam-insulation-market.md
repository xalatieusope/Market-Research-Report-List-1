<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spray Foam Insulation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-Cell Foam</li><li>Closed-Cell Foam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spray foam insulation market is primarily divided into two types: open-cell foam and closed-cell foam. Open-cell foam is characterized by its porous structure, which allows air to fill the cells, making it lighter and providing excellent soundproofing and flexibility. It is commonly used in interior applications. Closed-cell foam, on the other hand, has a denser structure that provides high insulation value, moisture resistance, and structural integrity, making it suitable for exterior applications and areas prone to humidity.</p></p>
